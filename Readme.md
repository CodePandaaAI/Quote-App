# Daily Quote App

A simple Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that displays a random quote from a predefined list. Perfect for a quick dose of inspiration without needing an internet connection!

## üåü Features

* **Offline Access:** All quotes are stored locally within the app.
* **Simple UI:** A clean and minimalist design focusing on the quote.

## ‚ú® How It Works (Under the Hood)

The app maintains a static list of quotes. When the "Next Quote" button is pressed, the app randomly selects an index from this list and updates the displayed text. This demonstrates:

* **State Management:** How to manage UI state (the currently displayed quote).
* **Event Handling:** Responding to user input (button clicks).
* **Basic UI Composition:** Laying out text and buttons using composable functions.
* **Randomization:** Using Kotlin's `Random` class to pick a quote.
